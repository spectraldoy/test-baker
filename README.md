# test-taker
A small web app for creating and taking timed tests.

## Setting up

First you have to install Node, which you can download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you have Node, you will also have `npm` installed, which is required to run this React app. Now, clone this repository, `cd` into it if necessary, and install the required packages as follows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/spectraldoy/test-taker
cd test-taker
npm install
```

## Running the app

Now that you have everything installed, all you need to do to run the app is to run the following from the `test-taker` directory:
```sh
npm start
```
If you're on Windows you'll probably need Git bash or another Unix-like Terminal to do this.
