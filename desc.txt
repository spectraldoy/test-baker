Idea:

User inputs a set of questions each with a time limit in m:s or h:m:s format
app flips through each of them, with an input box to save answers, and
displays Question: Answer at the end

TODO: Persistence of questions
shouldn't be too hard to write them all to a file questions.txt, separated
by \n
start with time in minutes

Process:
1. Question menu (could have a load questions? option in the future)
    a. Add a question? | Done.
        i. yes -> b.
        ii. no -> 2.
    b. Input question
        i. type your question (must have no newlines)
        ii. how much time do you have for it?
        iii. done.
    c. loop back to a.
    d. write each question to a file questions_{date}.txt
2. Start window
    a. Are you ready? Start button
        i. Start -> 3
        ii. Just wait
3. Test window
    a. set i to 1
    b. if i >= n, go to 4., else
    c. display question i
    d. set timer to timer[i]
    e. start countdown
    f. Show an input box for the answer
        i. Done -> cut time off, set i = i + 1, and loop to b.
        ii. else wait
    g. if the countdown reaches 0, set i = i + 1 and loop to b even if
       no input has been given (set input to None)
4. Answers window
    a. Display (Question | Time taken \n Answer)
    b. option to exit app
